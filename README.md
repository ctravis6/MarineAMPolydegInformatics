### <span style= "font-family:Courier;color:SlateBlue"> *The goal of this work is to select material candidates, manufacturable by extrusion-based 3D printing, that best resist marine degradation over time. This work attempts to explore and apply materials informatics-based approaches to accomplish its goal.* 
    
    

### <span style= "font-family:Courier;color:DarkSeaGreen"> *The molecular-level mechanisms and hierarchal structure-property trends related to degradation may be quantified through data analysis. These trends may be used to predict long-term bulk performance in undersea environments and give guidance for next-generation design*

## <span style= "font-family:Courier;color:Indigo">[I. Specific Approaches]
    
---
    
### <span style="font-family:Courier;color:SlateBlue">Traditional experimental approaches (empircal science, theory) for testing material systems narrows possibilities for high-quality solutions. 
    
    
- <span style="font-family:Courier">**With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science.**
    - **Simulation**
    - **Big data (materials informatics/machine learning)**
    
---
> ### <span style="font-family:Courier">Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge.

- <span style="font-family:Courier">Through a combined approach, data science can be used to extract new information from data, theory, and simulation. Through this, we can make better predictions for ideal candidates (rational co-design)
- <span style="font-family:Courier">**Material informatics provides the ability to study significantly larger chemical spaces, thereby guiding future research activities and building confidence in results**

#### <span style="font-family:Courier">*The goal of machine learning (ML) is to develop computer algorithms that can automatically improve their ability to solve a target problem by extracting information from past experience (training data).*

> ### <span style= "font-family:Courier;color:SlateBlue">In the study of polymer degradation and durability, there is a lack of reliable, predictive methodologies that are universally valid over a wide range of temperatures and durations of time. Many types of high-temperature, accelerated oven tests are unrealistic. In the mean time, for practical reasons, long-term experimental studies are extremely difficult to conduct.

- <span style="font-family:Courier">**Likewise, accelerated aging tests in simulated seawater may induce different degradation pathways than those occuring undersea in real time.** 
- <span style="font-family:Courier">**Although this method has been suitable for our analysis purposes, data science and computer simulation can be applied to enhance our predictions and understanding.** 
- <span style="font-family:Courier;color:SlateBlue">***Here, we can unveil the molecular-scale phenomena and predict trends for degradation based on specific chemical units and morphologies.***

> ## <span style="font-family:Courier;color:DarkSeaGreen">Successful application of this approach requires large, high-quality datasets for proper analysis. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers

### <span style="font-family:Courier"> *For selecting appropriate data to build datasets, fundamental understandings of polymeric behaviors are required.*
